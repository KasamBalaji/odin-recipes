            <li>4 tablespoons Toor Dal (toovar dal/arhar dal/split pigeon pea)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Chana Dal (gram lentil)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Moong Dal</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Masoor Dal</li>
            <li>1.5 cups + 3/4 cup Water</li>
            <li>1 medium Tomato, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 large Onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 cloves Garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1/2-inch Ginger, crushed</li>
            <li>2 Green Chillies, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons Ghee (clarified butter)</li>
            <li>3 Cloves</li>
            <li>1 Cinnamon stick, broken into 2-pieces</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons Cumin Seeds</li>
            <li>2 Dry Red Chillies</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Garam Masala Powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Turmeric Powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli Powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Coriander Powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped Coriander Leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps for Preparation</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Wash all dals in running water. Mix and soak them in water for 10 minutes. Drain water after 10 minutes and transfer to pressure cooker (3-5 liter size).</li>
            <li>Add salt and 1.5 cup water in pressure cooker and pressure-cook them over high flame. When 1 whistle is over, reduce flame to medium and cook for another 3 whistles.</li>
            <li>Do not open its lid immediately. Let it cool for 7-8 minutes or until pressure comes down naturally. This process is not only for the safety but also required to cook dal properly. Open the lid and keep cooked dal aside until needed. Do not blend or mash them.</li>
            <li>Now prepare spicy sauti. Heat ghee in a pan over medium flame. When it is hot enough to sauti, add cumin seeds, red dried chillies, cinnamon and cloves. When seeds begin to crackle, add chopped onion and stir-fry over medium flame until it turns light brown or for approx. 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add crushed ginger, crushed garlic and finely chopped green chilli; sauti for 20-30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add finely chopped tomatoes and salt (only required to soften tomatoes); cook until tomatoes turn tender.</li>
            <li>Add garam masala, coriander powder, red chilli powder, turmeric powder; mix them properly. Add pressure-cooked dals; mix and cook for a minute.</li>
            <li>Add lemon juice, 3/4 cup water and cook on medium flame for 4-5 minutes. Stir in between occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Turn off flame and transfer prepared daal to bowl. Garnish it with finely chopped coriander leaves.</li>
        </ol>
